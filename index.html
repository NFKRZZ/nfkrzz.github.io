         My name is Ravi Dhaliwal and I am a physics student at
            the University of California, Los Angeles. I spend a lot
            of my time focused on engineering oriented projects ranging
            from software projects to launching model rockets.

            I aim to enter an industry where I can fully utilize my skillset when I graduate.

           <h3>NASA L'SPACE NPWEE ACADEMY</h3>
           <p>For the fall of 2023, I was the principal investigator for my teams proposal of implementing super capacitors into satellite propulsions systems to better collision avoidance. </p>

           <h3>Student Researcher, UCR</h3>
           <p>From Summer 2022 to Winter 2023, I was involved in a research lab under Professor Venkatadriagaram focused on creating a low energy water filtration device. Specifically I worked on creating a venturi tube capable of producing a pressure drop of 30,000 pascals, enough to vaporize water. </p>

            <h3>Rear Wing Design </h3>
            <p>I designed a rear wing using the NACA 4418 aerofoil design. The wing features two splitters at different angles of attack. I then simulated the downforce produced by the wing at various speeds using STAR CCM+. </p>

            <h3>Level Two Rocket</h3>
            <p>I designed and fabricated a 3 foot long rocket using 3d printed plastic, fiberglass, and cardboard. With a custom avionics system that logged down position, acceleration, and orientation data, it reached an apogee of 1000m using a J425 rocket motor.</p>

            <h3>Song Detection C++</h3>
            <p>Using FFTW, I created a song detection program that is similar to Shazam. It generates a hash table of the most intense frequencies throughout a given song and compares that to input data to determine what song it most likely matches.</p>

            <h3>Audio to MIDI C++</h3>
            <p>This project was focused on transcibing audio files to MIDI files that could be used in a DAW like FL Studio. To do this I utilized FFTW to construct a spectrogram of the song, logging the most intense frequencies throughout discrete chunks of the song. I then clamped these frequencies to the nearest neighbor frequency according to what key the song was in. Finally I am working on creating a machine learning algorithm that will accuratley detect whether a note is being pressed or unpressed based off of the songs intensity data</p>

            <h3>r/place Bot C#</h3>
            <p>For r/Place 2023 I created a software that used hundreds of bot accounts to participate in the event as if they were actual users. To interact with the website I used the standard HTTP library included in .NET and I employed proxies to avoid IP bans. The bot software was multithreaded to ensure each worker could function in parrallel to each other.</p>
